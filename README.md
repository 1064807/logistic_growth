# Logistic Growth

Here are the R scripts for a reproducible analysis of logistic growth using "experiment2.csv" ðŸ”— : 

__*Question 1*__

When fitting a linear model, I used:
- *t<400* for datasubset1 (i.e. Case 1 where K >> N<sub>0</sub> and N<sub>t</sub> is small; this is a point in time prior to the population plateauing)
- *t>1000* for datasubset2 (i.e. Case 2 where N<sub>t</sub> = K; this is a point in time after the population reaches carrying capacity, K)

This plot shows the logistic growth data with vertical lines indicating t for Case 1 and Case 2 ðŸ“ˆ

![Plot showing Logistic Growth Data with Vertical Lines Indicating t for Case 1 and Case 2 ðŸ“ˆ](https://github.com/sathvikakrishnan/logistic_growth/blob/main/plot.png?raw=true)

From this, I extracted:
- N<sub>0</sub> = 7.5907133 This is the intercept of summary of model 1 from datasubset1 (linear model)
  
- r = 0.0299202 This is the gradient of summary of model 1 from datasubset1 
  
- K = 1000000000 This is the intercept of summary of model 2 from datasubset2

__*Question 2*__

Assuming exponential population growth:
When t=4980 min, N<sub>t</sub>=3.902005 &times; 10<sup>65</sup>

Assuming logistic population growth:
When t=4980 min, N<sub>t</sub>=1 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>

We can see that if we use the exponential model for population growth, we get a population size that extensively exceeds the carrying capacity (K). In fact, the answer is 3.902005 &times; 10<sup>56</sup> times larger than the carrying capacity (which is 1000000000). This is contrasted by the logistic growth model. In this model, there is a carrying capacity so the population plateaus out at 1000000000. Therefore, even at a large time point of t=4980, the population remains at carrying capacity. This difference between models can be explained biologically: the exponential models assume unlimited resources, constant birth and death rates, no density-dependent factors, and constant environmental conditions. As a result of all these assumptions, particularly the lack of density-dependent factors, the population is allowed to grow ad infinitum. This is biologically unreasonable. The logistic model does not make these assumptions as it has a carrying capacity (i.e. the equilibrium population size where the available resources in an ecosystem are sufficient to sustain the population given limited resources and density-dependent regulation).

__*Question 3*__

This graph compares the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same
parameter estimates I found in Question 1). ðŸ“ˆ

This graph compares the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same
parameter estimates I found in Question 1) however, a log transformation has been applied to the population size. ðŸ“ˆ

__*Question 4*__
![Two Random Walks](https://github.com/sathvikakrishnan/logistic_growth/blob/ca91c0a223d46725fac2fe7159bf8e7706df4835/Random_Walk_Plot.png)

The random walks are depicted in two plots plotted side-by-side. The plots depict the paths of random walks over 500 steps. Despite both walks starting at 0,0, they have indivdiual trajectories with random angles due to the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in random walks. The directions are uncorrelated (i.e. the direction of movement is  independent of the previous directions moved) and unbiased (i.e. the direction of motion is random). As a result of these two features, the trajectories seem unpredictable and each path is unique. The colour variation along the paths represents the progression of time in both walks. Earlier steps are darker blue and later steps are lighter blue as indicated by the colour gradient key.
